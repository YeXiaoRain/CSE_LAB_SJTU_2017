> $ docker run hello-world

you will see some results like

> Hello from Docker!

....


### List images

> docker images

will list all the docker image in the current machine

### Pull docker images

You can search a docker image in the DockerHub(link:https://hub.docker.com/)

When you find a image you want to use, take the `cselab_env` image(link:https://hub.docker.com/r/ddnirvana/cselab_env/) as an example, you can pull the image by

> docker pull ddnirvana/cselab_env:latest

hereï¼Œ `ddnirvana/sharekernel_env` is the name of the image, `:latest` is the tag of the image, which means the newest version of a image.

After the `docker pull ` success, you can see the image has been downloaded in your local machine by `docker images`  command

### Run CSELAB_ENV image

1 . create a dir in the host machine, for example
> mkdir -p /home/dd/courses/cse/lab_hostdir

2 . run a container
> docker run -it --rm -v /home/dd/courses/cse/lab_hostdir:/home/devlop ddnirvana/cselab_env:latest /bin/bash

This command means we want to run a container from the image `ddnirvana/cselab_env:latest`. `-it` means attach the container's terminal to current terminal. `--rm`  means remove the container when you exit it. ` -v /home/dd/courses/cse/lab_hostdir:/home/devlop` means mount the host dir `/home/dd/courses/cse/lab_hostdir` to the container's dir `/home/devlop`. 

**Notes**: everything in a docker container will be cleaned after you exit a container, so you need to store every usefull files in a mountted volume, in the above example, only files in `/home/devlop` in container will be persistent and every modification in these files will be persistent.
